## About Me
I am a computer engineering student who currently programs with C++, and TypeScript. I can also comfortably code in Matlab, Python, and Java. I have a hobby for programming videogames, libraries, and other related projects. My current main goal is to build a game engine for 2.5D games because that is a graphical style that I have adored for years, even if it takes me forever to build something like that.

I also have a hobby for archery and music :D

## Current Projects
These are the projects I am working on currently, or are likely on break but will come back to in the future
- [Triple-M (npm package)](https://github.com/Henderythmix/triple-m) - A Markup language that compiles into HTML for static pages that do not need as much javascript.

### MesaGuilde
[MesaGuilde](https://github.com/MesaGuildeTeam) is a casual startup software team of close connections (mainly friends) with a goal of sharing games that we think can be fun. 
Although all the projects are currently private, here are the projects that I lead
- [Carpenter Engine](https://github.com/MesaGuildeTeam/Carpenter-Engine) - a C++ Game Engine with a "build once, run anywhere" approach to game development
  - The goal of this project is to develop a game engine that can potentially be easily distributable by making it a web first game engine
  - Originally written in C++ and JavaScript, the framework is in the progress of being ported to Haxe and compiled to these platforms
- MesaGuilde website

## Retired Projects
These projects are very likely short term projects, or long terms that I have stopped working on and are no longer maintained. These are not as important as they are old, but they are a representation of me actually working on projects in the past
- [Snakelock (Game)](https://github.com/Henderythmix/Snakelock) - A game made in C++ and raylib during a week-long game jam after 2 months of experience. ~~Scored 2nd Place~~
- [Mariana's Trench (Game)](https://github.com/Henderythmix/MarianasTrench) - A C++/Raylib game for Brackeys Jam 2023.2 used to experiment with making a framework for game development
- [ESSS Website](https://github.com/sfuesss/website/tree/Revision2025) - As a Director of Website at Simon Fraser University's Engineering Science Student Society, I revised the website. This version was deployed as of Fall 2023.
  - This version is currently programmed with Triple-M, SCSS, and Javascript
  - The most recent branch I worked on was Revision2025 before I resigned the position due to personal reasons that made me decide I do not have time to work on this.
- [SFU Robot Soccer Website](https://sfurobotsoccer.com/) - Maintained this website from January 2024 to April 2024
  - This version used Svelte, TypeScript, and CS
